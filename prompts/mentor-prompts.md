Are you able to see all of my github repositories? Here's a link to my github profile:
https://github.com/MartyBonacci


I have been coding for over 40 years. I have been teaching website development at CNM's Deep Dive Coding
Bootcamp since 2018. Other than taking the coding bootcamp in 2017, I have no formal training in coding
but a lot of experience writing code for my own businesses. Since I work at CNM, I can take classes for
free. I'm currently finishing my last 2 classes, including this capstone which requires a portfolio
website. Let's make it showcase my best work.
The notable github repos are:
customcult - custom snowboard website hosted at customcult.com
specswarm - claude code plugin for spec driven development
frame-injection - Generative AI quality impovement techniques
collaborative-frame - Generative AI quality impovement techniques
expressibility-gap - AI communication
four-minds-pattern - - Generative AI quality impovement techniques
customcult2 - updated website stack
spec-kit-extensions - plugin for spec driven development that extends github/spec-kit features
custom-dept - my personal website project from when I took the coding bootcamp back in 2017...but with
the start of the snowboard presentation system that was ultimatly developed into customcult
Please help me develop ideas for this capstone portfolio website showcasing my best works.


Please provide a prompt
that I can copy and paste into another claude code instance opened in
/home/marty/code-projects/capstone-mentor/capstone to continue this development in that location using
the "/specswarm:build" command
